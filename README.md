# PhotoHub
This is an **Angular app** for photography. It was created for educational purposes only. PhotoHub is a place where users can browse and upload their photos. **Authenticated users** are able to **create** posts, **edit**, and **delete** them. The users that are not authenticated are only allowed to browse and see the details for a post. Logged-in users can also **like** and **unlike** a post. The creator of the post cannot like his own post.

In order to start the app:
- you need to have **MongoDB** installed on your machine
- in the terminal navigate to the root folder and run ```npm install```
- navigate to the **server** folder and run ```npm start``` in order to start the server
- navigate to the **client** folder and run ```npm start``` in order to start the client
- You can now open the project at http://localhost:4200/
